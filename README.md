CURVETOPIA: Exploring the Realm of Curved Lines
CURVETOPIA is a robust software for finding, smoothing, and enhancing 2D curves. This project uses smart methods to work with line sets and show results in different ways, making it great for design, art, and data display tasks.
Main Features
Curve Finding: Automatically spot and split curves from complex shapes.
Smoothing: Even out curves and fix bumps to make them look consistent.
Enhancement: Improve curves to look better, including making them more even and complete.
File Changing: Turn line sets from CSV files into SVG and PNG types to work well with other tools.
Display: Interactive curve plotting to check and confirm changes.
How It Works
i have added a zip file so all the adta and code can be easily download.
Get CSV Files: Bring in line sets from CSV files, where each row shows a path with points.
Working: Use methods to find and smooth curves, handling things like evenness and completeness.
SVG and PNG Making: Turn processed curves into SVG and PNG types for clear visuals.
Showing: Plot and display curves using matplotlib to review results before saving.
Setup
Copy the project and install needed parts using pip:
git clone https://github.com/Tanuja-0431/Adobe-project.git
cd curvescape
pip install -r requirements.txt

Using It
Put your CSV files in the project folder.
Run the main script to work on files, make SVGs, and PNGs:
python curve_smoothing.py

Look at the output files in the project folder for processed curves.
Sample
The project has sample CSV files in the data folder. After running the script, you can see the results in the output folder.
